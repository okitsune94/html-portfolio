<h2>My Top 3 Movies of All-Time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind</h3>
<p>Really cool movie; it made me think about how people are temporary and how we should enjoy the time we have with them.</p>
<h3>Maze Runner</h3>
<p>It is an amazing sci-fi movie.</p>
<h3>A Haunted House</h3>
<p>This is a great comedy but it is for adults only. Loved it, made me choke while laughing.</p>
